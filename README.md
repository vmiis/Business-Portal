# Business Portal

https://vmiis.github.io/business-portal/index.html

Business data sharing and collaboration between people (staff, clients, business partners, service providers, managers, board members...) are necessary for business success. 

With one login and permissions from business data owner everyone can involve business activities. 

Add what you need, remove what you don’t need. Every part can be customised. 

I am happy to build business portal for you if you have some business data to manage and you can describe the way or the logic you manage the data. 

I am also happy to help people to move business data in spreadsheets to cloud for data collaboration (such as data entry and data reporting). 

I would like to build a system to link more and more business data together so as to make business operation, management and collaboration easier, faster and more efficient.
